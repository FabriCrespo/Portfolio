      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
        My name is Fabricio Rene Crespo Rossel, and I'm 22 years old. I have completed all academic semesters for Computer Systems Engineering, with only the final degree certification pending. I've been programming since I was 12, starting with languages like C# and Python.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
        One of my significant achievements is delivering <strong>five deployment-ready projects at UMA for Universidad del Valle</strong>, which earned me a letter of recommendation from my department director.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Additionally, I developed a platform called <strong>Glucolog</strong> to monitor glucose levels in diabetic patients using AI and various tools, built with Next.js and Firebase.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
        My primary professional goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer with expertise across multiple languages, eventually transitioning into a project manager role to deliver well-developed solutions.
